fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/mburn9506-bot/Cprogramhow-to-run.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403

Ah! That 403 error is a GitHub permissions/authentication issue. The key part is:

Permission to mburn9506-bot/Cprogramhow-to-run.git 
denied to johnalain
It means GitHub thinks you (johnalain) don’t have 
access to push to that repo. On macOS, the easiest 
fix is to switch to SSH authentication or update your
 Git credentials with a Personal Access Token (PAT)
  for HTTPS. Let’s do this step by step.

Option 1: Use HTTPS with a Personal Access Token
 (recommended for beginners)
Generate a GitHub PAT:

Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → 
Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)

Click Generate new token → classic

Give it a name (e.g., "VSCode push")

Check these scopes:

repo (full control of private repos)

Copy the token (you won’t see it again!)

Update your Git credentials on Mac:
Open Terminal and run:

git remote set-url origin https://github.com/mburn9506-bot/Cprogramhow-to-run.git
git credential reject
Then push again:

git push -u origin main
When Git asks for username → type johnalain

When Git asks for password → paste the PAT you generated

This should work.

Option 2: Use SSH (recommended for long-term)
Generate SSH key (if you don’t already have one):

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
Accept defaults and optionally set a passphrase.

Add SSH key to GitHub:

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Copy the output and paste it in GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key.

Change Git remote to SSH:

git remote set-url origin git@github.com:mburn9506-bot/Cprogramhow-to-run.git
Test connection:

ssh -T git@github.com
Push:

git push -u origin main
💡 TL;DR: GitHub no longer allows password login. Either use PAT for HTTPS or SSH key. HTTPS with PAT is fastest for your case.

I can write the exact Mac Terminal commands in one go to fix this if you want. Do you want me to do that?

when i try to push doesn't ask for username and pass word
ChatGPT said:
Ah! That explains a lot. On modern GitHub (and other Git hosts),
 if Git isn’t prompting for username/password, it usually means one 
 of a few things is happening:

1️⃣ You’re using HTTPS but Git is caching credentials
Git can store credentials in a credential helper 
(like macOS Keychain). If your old credentials are wrong,
 Git won’t prompt again—it just fails.

You can check with:

git config --global credential.helper
On macOS, it’s often osxkeychain.

To force Git to forget saved credentials:

git credential-osxkeychain erase
or clear all cached credentials:

git credential-cache exit
2️⃣ You’re using HTTPS but GitHub no longer accepts passwords
GitHub removed password authentication for Git operations. 
Now you must use a personal access token (PAT) instead of your password.

If you haven’t created one:

Go to [GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal Access Tokens → Tokens (classic)].

Generate a token with repo permissions (for private repos) or public_repo (for public repos).

Copy it (you won’t see it again).

Then, when Git prompts for a password, use the token instead of your password.

3️⃣ Option: Switch to SSH
SSH avoids username/password issues entirely. Once you set up an SSH key, you just push without typing anything.

# generate key if you don't have one
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

# add key to ssh-agent
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# copy key to GitHub
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Then change your remote URL:

git remote set-url origin git@github.com:USERNAME/REPO.git
After that, push should just work.

If you want, I can write one-liner Mac terminal commands that will reset your credentials and let you push via HTTPS with a PAT in one go. That’s the fastest fix.

Do you want me to do that?
