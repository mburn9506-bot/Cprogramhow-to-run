ChatGPT said:
What you’re seeing is normal Git behavior, but a few things are happening at once. Let’s break it down step by step and clean things up.

1️⃣ Why did you see dquote>?
This happened because you started a commit message but didn’t close the quote:

git commit -m "c program
Git waited for the closing " and showed:

dquote>
You fixed it correctly by running:

git commit -m "c program"
✅ No problem there.

2️⃣ What actually got committed?
Only main1.c was staged and committed:

[main 2f050d2] c program
1 file changed, 9 insertions(+)
create mode 100644 main1.c
That means:

Git did exactly what you told it

Everything else is still untracked

3️⃣ Why do files still show as “Untracked”?
These files were never added with git add, so Git is just informing you they exist:

Untracked files:
  .RData
  .Rhistory
  .vscode/
  README.md
  dataset.R
  main2.c
  token.txt
  ...
Untracked ≠ error
It just means: “I see these files, but you didn’t ask me to track them.”

4️⃣ What should you do next? (Choose ONE path)
✅ Option A: Commit files you actually want
If you want to track some files (example: README + C files):

git add README.md main2.c
git commit -m "Add README and second C program"
Or add everything (not recommended yet):

git add .
git commit -m "Add project files"
❌ Option B: Ignore files that should NOT be committed (recommended)
Some of these should never be in Git, especially:

.RData

.Rhistory

.vscode/

token.txt ⚠️ (security risk!)

compiled binaries: main, main1, main2

Create a .gitignore file:

nano .gitignore
Add this:

# R files
.RData
.Rhistory

# VS Code
.vscode/

# Compiled binaries
main
main1
main2

# Secrets
token.txt
Then:

git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Add gitignore"
5️⃣ Why this matters (important for school projects)
Prevents leaking tokens/passwords

Keeps repo clean

Makes grading & collaboration easier

Avoids committing auto-generated junk

✅ Your repo status is HEALTHY
Nothing is broken.
You:
✔ committed main1.c correctly
✔ did not accidentally commit junk
✔ just need to decide what to track vs ignore

If you want, tell me:

Which files are assignments

Which language(s) you’re submitting

I’ll give you a perfect .gitignore and commit plan for school 👍

You said:
Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
ChatGPT said:
That message means Git cannot authenticate you to the remote repository. It’s not about your local files — it’s about access to GitHub/GitLab/etc.

Let’s diagnose it cleanly.

1️⃣ See exactly what remote you’re using
Run this:

git remote -v
You’ll likely see something like:

HTTPS (common for beginners)
origin  https://github.com/USERNAME/myPROJECTR.git
SSH
origin  git@github.com:USERNAME/myPROJECTR.git
This matters for the fix.

2️⃣ Most common causes (90% of the time)
❌ Cause A: You don’t own the repo / no permission
Repo belongs to someone else

You weren’t added as a collaborator

Repo name or username is wrong

✅ Fix:

Check the repo URL in your browser

Make sure you are logged into the same account

❌ Cause B: Using HTTPS without authentication
GitHub no longer allows passwords for HTTPS.

If you tried:

git push origin main
and got:

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
You need a Personal Access Token (PAT) instead of a password.

✅ Fix (HTTPS):

Create token on GitHub
→ Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
→ Give repo permission

Push again:

git push origin main
When asked:

Username: your GitHub username

Password: paste the token (not your GitHub password)

❌ Cause C: SSH key not set up (if using SSH)
If your remote starts with git@github.com:

Test SSH:

ssh -T git@github.com
If you see:

Permission denied (publickey)
then SSH is not configured.

✅ Fix:

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Copy that key → GitHub → Settings → SSH Keys → Add key

3️⃣ Quick fix (recommended for students)
If you want the simplest solution, switch to HTTPS:

git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/myPROJECTR.git
git push origin main
Then authenticate with a Personal Access Token.

4️⃣ Verify repo actually exists
In browser, confirm:

https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/myPROJECTR
If it 404s → repo doesn’t exist or wrong name.

5️⃣ Summary
Error Cause	Solution
No repo access	Check ownership / collaborator
HTTPS auth	Use GitHub token
SSH auth	Add SSH key
Wrong repo URL	Fix git remote
If you want a direct fix, paste the output of:
git remote -v
I’ll tell you exactly what to run next.

how to reset credentials git
ChatGPT said:
Here’s how to reset Git credentials, depending on how you authenticate. Follow the section that matches your setup.

🔍 First: check which auth method you’re using
git remote -v
https://... → HTTPS credentials

git@github.com:... → SSH keys

🔐 Reset HTTPS credentials (MOST COMMON)
✅ macOS
git credential reject
protocol=https
host=github.com
(Press Enter twice after host=github.com)

OR open Keychain Access:

Search for github.com

Delete:

github.com

git:https://github.com

✅ Linux
git config --global --unset credential.helper
git config --global --set credential.helper store
Then remove stored credentials:

rm ~/.git-credentials
✅ Windows
Open Credential Manager

Windows Credentials

Remove anything related to:

github.com

git:https://github.com

🔁 Re-authenticate
Now push again:

git push origin main
When prompted:

Username → GitHub username

Password → Personal Access Token (NOT your GitHub password)

🔑 Reset SSH credentials (if using SSH)
Remove old keys
rm ~/.ssh/id_ed25519*
rm ~/.ssh/id_rsa*
Create new key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
Add to GitHub
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Paste into:
GitHub → Settings → SSH Keys → New Key

Test
ssh -T git@github.com
🔄 Force Git to forget EVERYTHING (nuclear option)
git config --global --unset-all credential.helper
rm ~/.git-credentials
Then retry push.

✅ Recommended (for school projects)
👉 Use HTTPS + token
It’s simpler and avoids SSH issues on lab computers.

🧪 Verify credentials are reset
git config --global --list | grep credential
If you want, paste:

git remote -v
and tell me OS (Windows/macOS/Linux) — I’ll give you the exact commands with no guessing.

You said:
➜  myPROJECTR git:(main) ✗ git remote -v

origin  git@github.com:mburn9506-bot/Cprogramhow-to-run.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:mburn9506-bot/Cprogramhow-to-run.git (push)
➜  myPROJECTR git:(main) ✗ >....                                                                                
host=github.com


fatal: refusing to work with credential missing host field
ChatGPT said:
Good — this output explains everything 👍
You are using SSH, not HTTPS:

git@github.com:mburn9506-bot/Cprogramhow-to-run.git
So the error you got:

fatal: refusing to work with credential missing host field
happened because you tried an HTTPS credential command on an SSH setup.
👉 SSH does not use stored credentials like username/password or tokens.

✅ What this means (important)
git credential reject ❌ → ONLY for HTTPS

Your problem is SSH key access, not “credentials”

We need to fix or reset your SSH key.

🔍 Step 1: Test SSH access
Run:

ssh -T git@github.com
If you see:
Hi mburn9506-bot! You've successfully authenticated
➡️ SSH is fine → repo permissions are the issue

If you see:
Permission denied (publickey)
➡️ SSH key is missing or not linked to GitHub

🔑 Step 2: Reset SSH keys (safe + recommended)
Remove old SSH keys
rm -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
rm -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
Generate a new SSH key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
Just press Enter for all prompts.

Add key to SSH agent
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
Copy the public key
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
📋 Copy the entire output.

🌐 Step 3: Add key to GitHub
GitHub → Settings

SSH and GPG keys

New SSH key

Paste the key

Save

🧪 Step 4: Test again
ssh -T git@github.com
You must see a success message.

🚀 Step 5: Push
git push origin main
⚠️ One more VERY important check
Your repo is owned by:

mburn9506-bot
Make sure:

You are logged into that GitHub account

OR your account is added as a collaborator

Otherwise SSH will authenticate but still deny push.

✅ Alternative (simpler for school)
Switch to HTTPS + token (no SSH headaches):

git remote set-url origin https://github.com/mburn9506-bot/Cprogramhow-to-run.git
git push origin main
Tell me:
Output of ssh -T git@github.com

Are you logged into mburn9506-bot or a different account?

I’ll give you the exact final fix, no guessing.

You said:
ssh -T git@github.com

Enter passphrase for key '/Users/michelkadi/.ssh/id_ed25519': 
git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).
ChatGPT said:
Perfect — this tells us exactly what’s wrong.

You do have an SSH key, but GitHub does NOT know about it (or it’s the wrong key).
That’s why you get:

Permission denied (publickey)
We’ll fix this cleanly in 5 minutes.

✅ Step-by-step FIX (macOS)
1️⃣ Make sure SSH agent is running
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
2️⃣ Add your key to the agent
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
Enter your passphrase when asked.

3️⃣ Copy your public key
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
📋 Copy EVERYTHING (starts with ssh-ed25519).

4️⃣ Add the key to GitHub
Open GitHub in your browser

Make sure you are logged in as mburn9506-bot

Go to
Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key

Title: MacBook

Paste the key

Save

5️⃣ Test authentication (this must succeed)
ssh -T git@github.com
You should see:

Hi mburn9506-bot! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
6️⃣ Push your code
git push origin main
🚨 If it STILL fails
You may be logged into the wrong GitHub account.

Your repo belongs to:

mburn9506-bot
If you are logged into a different account:

Either add that account as a collaborator

OR switch remote to HTTPS:

git remote set-url origin https://github.com/mburn9506-bot/Cprogramhow-to-run.git
git push origin main
(Use a GitHub Personal Access Token when prompted.)

🧠 Why this happened (quick explanation)
SSH uses keys, not passwords

GitHub rejects keys it doesn’t recognize

Your local key existed but wasn’t registered

Send me the output of:
ssh -T git@github.com
after Step 5 if anything goes wrong — I’ll finish it with you 👍

What you’re seeing is normal Git behavior, but a few things are happening at once. Let’s break it down step by step and clean things up.

1️⃣ Why did you see dquote>?

This happened because you started a commit message but didn’t close the quote:

git commit -m "c program


Git waited for the closing " and showed:

You fixed it correctly by running:

git commit -m "c program"


✅ No problem there.

2️⃣ What actually got committed?

Only main1.c was staged and committed:

[main 2f050d2] c program
1 file changed, 9 insertions(+)
create mode 100644 main1.c


That means:

Git did exactly what you told it

Everything else is still untracked

3️⃣ Why do files still show as “Untracked”?

These files were never added with git add, so Git is just informing you they exist:

Untracked files:
  .RData
  .Rhistory
  .vscode/
  README.md
  dataset.R

how to reset credentials git

Here’s how to reset Git credentials, depending on how you authenticate. Follow the section that matches your setup.

🔍 First: check which auth method you’re using
git remote -v


https://... → HTTPS credentials

git@github.com:... → SSH keys

🔐 Reset HTTPS credentials (MOST COMMON)
✅ macOS
git credential reject
protocol=https
host=github.com


(Press Enter twice after host=github.com)

OR open Keychain Access:

Search for github.com

Delete:

github.com

git:https://github.com

✅ Linux
git config --global --unset credential.helper
git config --global --set credential.helper store


Then remove stored credentials:

rm ~/.git-credentials

✅ Windows

Open Credential Manager

Windows Credentials

Remove anything related to:

github.com

git:https://github.com

🔁 Re-authenticate

Now push again:

git push origin main


When prompted:

Username → GitHub username

Password → Personal Access Token (NOT your GitHub password)

🔑 Reset SSH credentials (if using SSH)
Remove old keys
rm ~/.ssh/id_ed25519*
rm ~/.ssh/id_rsa*

Create new key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

Add to GitHub
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub


Paste into:
GitHub → Settings → SSH Keys → New Key

Test
ssh -T git@github.com

🔄 Force Git to forget EVERYTHING (nuclear option)
git config --global --unset-all credential.helper
rm ~/.git-credentials


Then retry push.

✅ Recommended (for school projects)

👉 Use HTTPS + token
It’s simpler and avoids SSH issues on lab computers.

🧪 Verify credentials are reset
git config --global --list | grep credential


If you want, paste:

git remote -v


and tell me OS (Windows/macOS/Linux) — I’ll give you the exact commands with no guessing.

➜  myPROJECTR git:(main) ✗ git remote -v

origin  git@github.com:mburn9506-bot/Cprogramhow-to-run.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:mburn9506-bot/Cprogramhow-to-run.git (push)
➜  myPROJECTR git:(main) ✗ >....                                                                                
host=github.com


fatal: refusing to work with credential missing host field

Good — this output explains everything 👍
You are using SSH, not HTTPS:

git@github.com:mburn9506-bot/Cprogramhow-to-run.git


So the error you got:

fatal: refusing to work with credential missing host field


happened because you tried an HTTPS credential command on an SSH setup.
👉 SSH does not use stored credentials like username/password or tokens.

✅ What this means (important)

git credential reject ❌ → ONLY for HTTPS

Your problem is SSH key access, not “credentials”

We need to fix or reset your SSH key.

🔍 Step 1: Test SSH access

Run:

ssh -T git@github.com

If you see:
Hi mburn9506-bot! You've successfully authenticated


➡️ SSH is fine → repo permissions are the issue

If you see:
Permission denied (publickey)


➡️ SSH key is missing or not linked to GitHub

🔑 Step 2: Reset SSH keys (safe + recommended)
Remove old SSH keys
rm -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
rm -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Generate a new SSH key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"


Just press Enter for all prompts.

Add key to SSH agent
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

Copy the public key
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub


📋 Copy the entire output.

🌐 Step 3: Add key to GitHub

GitHub → Settings

SSH and GPG keys

New SSH key

Paste the key

Save

🧪 Step 4: Test again
ssh -T git@github.com


You must see a success message.

🚀 Step 5: Push
git push origin main

⚠️ One more VERY important check

Your repo is owned by:

mburn9506-bot


Make sure:

You are logged into that GitHub account

OR your account is added as a collaborator

Otherwise SSH will authenticate but still deny push.

✅ Alternative (simpler for school)

Switch to HTTPS + token (no SSH headaches):

git remote set-url origin https://github.com/mburn9506-bot/Cprogramhow-to-run.git
git push origin main

Tell me:

Output of ssh -T git@github.com

Are you logged into mburn9506-bot or a different account?

I’ll give you the exact final fix, no guessing.

ssh -T git@github.com

Enter passphrase for key '/Users/michelkadi/.ssh/id_ed25519': 
git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).

Perfect — this tells us exactly what’s wrong.

You do have an SSH key, but GitHub does NOT know about it (or it’s the wrong key).
That’s why you get:

Permission denied (publickey)


We’ll fix this cleanly in 5 minutes.

✅ Step-by-step FIX (macOS)
1️⃣ Make sure SSH agent is running
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

2️⃣ Add your key to the agent
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519


Enter your passphrase when asked.

3️⃣ Copy your public key
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub


📋 Copy EVERYTHING (starts with ssh-ed25519).

4️⃣ Add the key to GitHub

Open GitHub in your browser

Make sure you are logged in as mburn9506-bot

Go to
Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key

Title: MacBook

Paste the key

Save

5️⃣ Test authentication (this must succeed)
ssh -T git@github.com


You should see:

Hi mburn9506-bot! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

6️⃣ Push your code
git push origin main

🚨 If it STILL fails

You may be logged into the wrong GitHub account.

Your repo belongs to:

mburn9506-bot


If you are logged into a different account:

Either add that account as a collaborator

OR switch remote to HTTPS:

git remote set-url origin https://github.com/mburn9506-bot/Cprogramhow-to-run.git
git push origin main


(Use a GitHub Personal Access Token when prompted.)

🧠 Why this happened (quick explanation)

SSH uses keys, not passwords

GitHub rejects keys it doesn’t recognize

Your local key existed but wasn’t registered

Send me the output of:
ssh -T git@github.com


after Step 5 if anything goes wrong — I’ll finish it with you 👍
1️⃣ Why did you see dquote>?

This happened because you started a commit message but didn’t close the quote:

git commit -m "c program


Git waited for the closing " and showed:

dquote>


You fixed it correctly by running:

git commit -m "c program"


✅ No problem there.

2️⃣ What actually got committed?

Only main1.c was staged and committed:

[main 2f050d2] c program
1 file changed, 9 insertions(+)
create mode 100644 main1.c


That means:

Git did exactly what you told it

Everything else is still untracked

3️⃣ Why do files still show as “Untracked”?

These files were never added with git add, so Git is just informing you they exist:

Untracked files:
  .RData
  .Rhistory
  .vscode/
  README.md
  dataset.R
  main2.c
  token.txt
  ...


Untracked ≠ error
It just means: “I see these files, but you didn’t ask me to track them.”

4️⃣ What should you do next? (Choose ONE path)
✅ Option A: Commit files you actually want

If you want to track some files (example: README + C files):

git add README.md main2.c
git commit -m "Add README and second C program"


Or add everything (not recommended yet):

git add .
git commit -m "Add project files"

❌ Option B: Ignore files that should NOT be committed (recommended)

Some of these should never be in Git, especially:

.RData

.Rhistory

.vscode/

token.txt ⚠️ (security risk!)

compiled binaries: main, main1, main2

Create a .gitignore file:

nano .gitignore


Add this:

# R files
.RData
.Rhistory

# VS Code
.vscode/

# Compiled binaries
main
main1
main2

# Secrets
token.txt


Then:

git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Add gitignore"

5️⃣ Why this matters (important for school projects)

Prevents leaking tokens/passwords

Keeps repo clean

Makes grading & collaboration easier

Avoids committing auto-generated junk

✅ Your repo status is HEALTHY

Nothing is broken.
You:
✔ committed main1.c correctly
✔ did not accidentally commit junk
✔ just need to decide what to track vs ignore

If you want, tell me:

Which files are assignments

Which language(s) you’re submitting

I’ll give you a perfect .gitignore and commit plan for school 👍

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.

That message means Git cannot authenticate you to the remote repository. It’s not about your local files — it’s about access to GitHub/GitLab/etc.

Let’s diagnose it cleanly.

1️⃣ See exactly what remote you’re using

Run this:

git remote -v


You’ll likely see something like:

HTTPS (common for beginners)
origin  https://github.com/USERNAME/myPROJECTR.git

SSH
origin  git@github.com:USERNAME/myPROJECTR.git


This matters for the fix.

2️⃣ Most common causes (90% of the time)
❌ Cause A: You don’t own the repo / no permission

Repo belongs to someone else

You weren’t added as a collaborator

Repo name or username is wrong

✅ Fix:

Check the repo URL in your browser

Make sure you are logged into the same account

❌ Cause B: Using HTTPS without authentication

GitHub no longer allows passwords for HTTPS.

If you tried:

git push origin main


and got:

Please make sure you have the correct access rights


You need a Personal Access Token (PAT) instead of a password.

✅ Fix (HTTPS):

Create token on GitHub
→ Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
→ Give repo permission

Push again:

git push origin main


When asked:

Username: your GitHub username

Password: paste the token (not your GitHub password)

❌ Cause C: SSH key not set up (if using SSH)

If your remote starts with git@github.com:

Test SSH:

ssh -T git@github.com


If you see:

Permission denied (publickey)


then SSH is not configured.

✅ Fix:

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub


Copy that key → GitHub → Settings → SSH Keys → Add key

3️⃣ Quick fix (recommended for students)

If you want the simplest solution, switch to HTTPS:

git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/myPROJECTR.git
git push origin main


Then authenticate with a Personal Access Token.

4️⃣ Verify repo actually exists

In browser, confirm:

https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/myPROJECTR


If it 404s → repo doesn’t exist or wrong name.

5️⃣ Summary
Error Cause	Solution
No repo access	Check ownership / collaborator
HTTPS auth	Use GitHub token
SSH auth	Add SSH key
Wrong repo URL	Fix git remote
If you want a direct fix, paste the output of:
git remote -v


I’ll tell you exactly what to run next.
